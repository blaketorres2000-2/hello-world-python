# Overview

As part of my ongoing journey to advance my programming skills, I am focusing on writing and executing basic Python programs. This practice will help me solidify fundamental concepts and get comfortable with the development environment. In this project, I created a simple "Hello World" program using Python in Visual Studio Code.

**Description:**
This software is a straightforward Python script that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console. It serves as an introductory exercise to familiarize myself with the basics of Python syntax and the development workflow in Visual Studio Code. It will also allow me to get more familiar with pushing files to GitHub.

**Purpose:**
The purpose of creating this software is to establish a solid foundation in Python programming by starting with fundamental exercises. It helps me learn the essentials of coding in Python, allowing for more complex projects in the future.
